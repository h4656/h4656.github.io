# How do I Evaluate the Success of My Model?

The following documents the methods and tools I have used to evaluate the success of the artificial intelligence models I have developed through the Fast Ai course:
- [Confusion Matrices](#confusion)
- [t-SNE](#tsne)

>ðŸ’¡**Note:** Methods of evaluation should be used on the validation set of data and not that used as part of the training set.
