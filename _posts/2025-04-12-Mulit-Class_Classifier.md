# Creating a Multi-Class Classifier with Fastai
---
Fastai has developed many libraries that enable the development of artificial intelligence models to be simple and easily accessible. Using the Fast AI course, I developed my own classifier model that can recognise images as being either an airplane, automobile, bird, cat, or dog. The following depicts the methods for creating the classifier model.

The classifier model was developed using the Fast Ai model 'is-it-a-bird', which classifies images as either a bird or a forest.
Get the Jupyter Notebook containing models used in the Fast AI Course by cloning the following Git Repository, then open the 'is-it-a-bird' notebook.
